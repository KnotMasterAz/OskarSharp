For Unity template, have a signal script generated with unique signals which each script can then use pass values and signals by
signal_send("player_signal", "die")

if (signal_received("player_signal", "die")) {
    kill_player()
    signal_clear_matches("player_signal", "die")
    signal_clear_all("player_signal");
}
