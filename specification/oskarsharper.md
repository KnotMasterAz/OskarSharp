# Oskar Sharper Proposal Specification

This is the specification for OskarSharper (preprocessor language), for specification details on the language, see [OskarSharp](oskarsharp.md)

## Code embedding
All OskarSharper code is embedded in the program using \`code\`, this allows short one-liners or even between parts of a line, or on the other end, full complex scripts.

OskarSharper cannot be run as a whole language and must be embedded in an OskarSharp file even if just using OskarSharper itself.
